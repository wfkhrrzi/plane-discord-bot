## Plane Interface

![Plane Interface](examples/plane.png)

The bot integrates with Plane's modern and intuitive interface, allowing you to manage your projects seamlessly between Discord and Plane's web interface. Above is an example of Plane's project management view, showcasing its clean design and powerful features.

## Features

- **Multi-Channel Support**: Configure different channels to connect to different Plane workspaces/projects
- Create new issues with title, description, and priority
- List issues with filtering by state and priority
- View detailed issue information with rich embeds
- Upload files to existing issues
- Color-coded priority levels (🔴 Urgent, 🟠 High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low)
- Support for issue labels and attachments
- Automatic state tracking with visual indicators
- Beautiful Discord embeds with formatted descriptions
- Direct integration with Plane's API
- Flexible storage options (JSON file or SQLite)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.9.0 or higher
- A Discord bot token and application
- A [Plane](https://plane.so) account with API access
  - Workspace(s) created
  - Project(s) set up
  - API key generated

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd plane-discord-bot
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Required
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key

# Optional: Storage configuration
STORAGE_TYPE=json    # "json" (default) or "sqlite"
```

4. Deploy slash commands

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

6. Configure channels (in Discord, as server admin)

```
/plane-setup workspace:your-workspace project:your-project-id
```

## Multi-Channel Configuration

The bot supports connecting different Discord channels to different Plane workspaces and projects. This allows teams to:

- Use one bot across multiple projects
- Have dedicated channels for different workspaces
- Manage multiple Plane instances from a single Discord server

> **Important:** Issue commands (`/create-issue`, `/get-issues`, `/view-issue`, `/upload-file`) will only work in channels that have been configured with `/plane-setup`. Unconfigured channels will show a "Channel Not Configured" message prompting an admin to run the setup command.

### Admin Commands

|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/plane-setup` | Configure a channel with workspace and project | Admin only |
| `/plane-config` | View current channel's configuration | Everyone |
| `/plane-remove` | Remove configuration from a channel | Admin only |
| `/plane-list` | List all configured channels in the server | Admin only |

### Setup Example

```
# In #frontend-bugs channel
/plane-setup workspace:acme-corp project:frontend-project-id

# In #backend-bugs channel
/plane-setup workspace:acme-corp project:backend-project-id

# In #mobile-team channel (different workspace)
/plane-setup workspace:mobile-division project:ios-app-id
```

## Storage Options

The bot supports two storage backends for channel configurations:

### JSON Storage (Default)

- No additional dependencies required
- Stores data in `./data/channels.json`
- Good for small deployments

### SQLite Storage

- Requires `better-sqlite3` package
- Stores data in `./data/channels.db`
- Better for larger deployments with many channels

To use SQLite:

```bash
npm install better-sqlite3
```

Then set in `.env`:

```env
STORAGE_TYPE=sqlite
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```env
# Discord Bot Configuration
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token    # Your Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id        # Your Discord application client ID

# Plane Configuration
PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key        # Your Plane API key from Settings > API Tokens

# Storage Configuration (optional)
STORAGE_TYPE=json                       # Storage backend: "json" (default) or "sqlite"
# STORAGE_PATH=./data                   # Optional: custom path for storage file

# Logging Configuration (optional)
LOG_LEVEL=info                          # Logging level: debug, info, warn, error
ENABLE_FILE_LOGS=false                  # Enable logging to files: true/false
```

### Where to Find the Values

#### Discord Configuration

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create or select your application
3. `CLIENT_ID`: Found in OAuth2 > General
4. `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Found in Bot > Token (Reset Token if needed)

#### Plane Configuration

1. `PLANE_API_KEY`: Generate from Settings > API Tokens
2. `WORKSPACE_SLUG`: The identifier in your Plane workspace URL
   - Example: `https://app.plane.so/YOUR-WORKSPACE-SLUG/...`
3. `PROJECT_ID`: Found in Project Settings > General

## Development

For development with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Docker Support

Build the container:

```bash
docker build -t plane-discord-bot .
```

Run with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name plane-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token \
  -e PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key \
  -e CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/usr/src/app/data \
  plane-discord-bot
```

> **Important:** You MUST mount a volume for `/usr/src/app/data` to persist channel configurations. Without the volume mount, all channel configurations will be lost when the container restarts.

For SQLite storage (optional):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name plane-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token \
  -e PLANE_API_KEY=your_plane_api_key \
  -e CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id \
  -e STORAGE_TYPE=sqlite \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/usr/src/app/data \
  plane-discord-bot
```

## Coolify Deployment

This bot supports deployment on [Coolify](https://coolify.io), a self-hostable PaaS.

### Option 1: Nixpacks (Recommended)

Nixpacks is the easiest deployment method with minimal configuration.

1. In Coolify, create a new service and select **Nixpacks**
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Set the required environment variables (see table below)
4. Add a persistent volume:
   - Source: Create a new volume
   - Destination: `/usr/src/app/data`
5. Deploy!

The included `nixpacks.toml` handles all build configuration automatically.

### Option 2: Docker Compose

1. In Coolify, create a new service and select **Docker Compose**
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Set the required environment variables (see table below)
4. The volume is already configured in `docker-compose.yml`
5. Deploy!

### Option 3: Dockerfile

1. In Coolify, create a new service and select **Dockerfile**
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Configure environment variables (see table below)
4. Add a persistent volume:
   - Source: Create a new volume
   - Destination: `/usr/src/app/data`
5. Deploy!

The Dockerfile uses Alpine Linux for reliable builds across different environments.

### Environment Variables for Coolify

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Yes | - | Discord bot token |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Yes | - | Discord application client ID |
| `PLANE_API_KEY` | Yes | - | Plane API key |
| `STORAGE_TYPE` | No | `json` | Storage backend (`json` or `sqlite`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Logging level |
| `ENABLE_FILE_LOGS` | No | `false` | Enable file logging |

> **Important:** Always configure persistent storage for `/usr/src/app/data` to preserve channel configurations across deployments.
